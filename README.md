## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a novel multimodal emotion recognition system based on the Navarasa framework. The research explores advanced techniques for recognizing emotions across multiple modalities.

## About

Navarasa (नवरस), derived from Sanskrit, refers to the nine fundamental emotions in Indian aesthetics. This work leverages this traditional framework to develop a comprehensive multimodal emotion recognition system.
